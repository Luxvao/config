# Config
These are my dotfiles. Install everything for hyprland with `./install_hyprland.sh` and install everything for bspwm with `./install_bspwm.sh`. If installing manually, do not install rofi with `stow rofi`. Instead run `./rofi/basic/install.sh`. The rofi directory is cloned directly from the official rofi catppuccin directory. I use catppuccin a lot. Thanks a ton for your work guys.
